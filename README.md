## Why This Project Exists

Many AI coding workflows eventually face the same problems:

- Agents do not proactively find the right Skill.
- New sessions forget role-specific rules.
- Skills become duplicated, overlapping, or hard to maintain.
- Coding agents lack a consistent engineering baseline.
- New Skills are added without updating an index or manual.
- Agents may blindly copy external Skills from GitHub.
- Claude Code and Codex rules are difficult to keep consistent.

This project provides a reusable bilingual template system for both international and Chinese users.

## English vs Chinese Templates

This repository provides two template sets:

```
templates/en
templates/zh
```

### English Templates

The English templates are designed for international users.

They do **not** force any specific response language.

Agents should respond in the user's language by default.

### Chinese Templates

The Chinese templates are designed for Chinese users and Chinese development teams.

They default to Chinese responses and include Chinese documentation conventions.

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Routing

Before handling a complex task, the agent should:

1. Check `skill-index.json`.
2. If needed, check the human-readable Skill manual.
3. Identify the task type, role, tech stack, keywords, and expected output.
4. Load only the 1 to 3 most relevant Skills.
5. Avoid loading all Skills at once.

### 2. Mandatory Programming Baseline

For programming-related work, the agent must use:

```
{{PROGRAMMING_BASELINE_SKILL}}
```

This applies to:

- Writing code / modifying code / refactoring / bug fixing
- Code review / API design / database design
- Test writing / architecture design / technical planning
- Frontend / backend / DevOps automation / AI Agent development

Default combination:

```
{{PROGRAMMING_BASELINE_SKILL}} + domain Skill + verification or security Skill
```

### 3. Skill Governance

Before creating a new Skill, the agent must check whether a similar Skill already exists.

If an existing Skill covers most of the workflow, do not create a new Skill.

If the new requirement is only a branch scenario, update the existing Skill instead.

A new Skill should only be created when:

- Existing Skills cannot cover the core workflow.
- It is not a small branch of an existing Skill.
- It is not just a renamed concept.
- It is likely to be reused.
- It has clear triggers, inputs, outputs, workflow, and avoid conditions.

### 4. External Skill Review

GitHub or external search should only be used when no suitable local Skill exists.

Do not directly install or copy external Skills without review.

Before adopting an external Skill, check whether it:

- Contains destructive commands.
- Reads secrets, tokens, cookies, SSH keys, or `.env` files.
- Uploads local files.
- Executes remote scripts.
- Contains obfuscated code.
- Depends on unknown MCP services.
- Bypasses user confirmation for high-risk actions.

After review, extract useful ideas and rewrite them as a local Skill draft.
